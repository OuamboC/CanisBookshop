## CanisBookshop

Customers select books, pay with MasterCard on the payment page, and validate the payment. If successful, they're redirected to a confirmation page. The website showcases optimized design and functionality for desktop and mobile, ensuring a secure and efficient user experience.

**Note:** This online shop is not operational, meaning you cannot make real purchases for any of the books.
